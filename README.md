# ComplicatedLoop

This program is going to loop a function and compare a user's answer to the correct one. I want the program to get integer input, decide whether the number is odd or even, and then prompt a user to answer the parity question. A user is going to have two attempts to answer the question. In case if the user can't get it right, I want the program to say 'User-loser.'
