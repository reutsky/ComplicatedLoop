# ComplicatedLoop

This program is going to loop a function and compare a user's answer to the correct one. I want the program to get integer input, decide whether the number is odd or even, and then prompt a user to answer the parity question. In case if the user can't get it right two times, I want the program to say 'User-loser.'
